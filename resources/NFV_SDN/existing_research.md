### VNF Forwarding Graphs
 - Reconfiguration of graph is the focus
 - Reconfiguration in multi domain envrironment
 - Reconfiguration in multi tenant evironment
 - ML and Genetic algorithm based approach for reconfigurations


### VNF placement and service chaining
 - Dynamic VNF placement and chaining
 - Cost-efficient VNF placement and chaining
 - Latency aware placement and chaining
 - Reliability-aware VNF placement and chaining
 - End-to-end performance-based autonomous VNF placement and chaining
 - A hybrid optimization-Machine Learning approach for the VNF placement 
 - QoS-aware VNF placement and service chaining
 - deep reinforcement learning techniques for VNF placement and chaining
 - how to deploy on the edge efficiently


### IoT
 - Most work is on architecture and service placement in the context IoT
 - Deployment strategy - QoS aware, letency aware

### Security
 - Security as a Service (SecaaS) not much work
 - Few works on security policy or policy based security for NFV management
 - couple of works on SDN based router as a VNF node with security facilities like detection/protection against DDoS etc.
 - some work on interfaces between security functions

 ### SDN as a VNF unit
  - as load balancer
  - as a firewall or node with security

### Virtualisation of the Home Environmen
 - very few works, available works are:
   - Building an NFV-based vRGW: Lessons learned. DOI: 10.1109/CCNC.2017.7983208
   - NFV and SDN-Based Differentiated Traffic Treatment for Residential Networks. 
   - NFV virtualisation of the home environment. DOI: 10.1109/CCNC.2014.6940493
